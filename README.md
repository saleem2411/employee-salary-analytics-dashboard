# Project Insights
- The organization has a total salary budget of 44M distributed across 500 employees, indicating a moderate-sized workforce with balanced compensation levels.
- The average performance score of 3.01 suggests that employee performance is fairly consistent and close to organizational expectations.
- A total bonus payout of 5M shows significant investment in employee rewards and retention programs.
- Major metropolitan cities such as Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Kolkata, and Delhi contribute almost equally to salary expenditure, each receiving between 5M–6M.
- The Finance department leads with the highest salary allocation, reaching close to 10M, indicating either a larger workforce or higher pay scales.

# Final Conclusion
The dashboard reveals a balanced salary distribution across cities and departments, with Finance showing the highest cost center. Workforce salary patterns indicate stability, while areas like resigned employee salary costs and unknown field data point toward HR operational improvements. The age-based salary trend aligns with career progression norms, and performance scores remain steady across the organization.
